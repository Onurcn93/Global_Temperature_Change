# Global_Temperature_Change
Analysis covers global temperature changes for different countries to understand results of global warming. Conducted as a personal project. It consists of pandas dF data handling, geospatial visualizations and hypothesis tests

## Data description

* The FAOSTAT Temperature Change domain disseminates statistics of mean surface temperature change by country, with annual updates. The current dissemination covers the period 1961–2019. 
* Statistics are available for monthly, seasonal and annual mean temperature anomalies, i.e., temperature change with respect to a baseline climatology, corresponding to the period 1951–1980. The standard deviation of the temperature change of the baseline methodology is also available. 
* Data are based on the publicly available GISTEMP data, the Global Surface Temperature Change data distributed by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Goddard Institute for Space Studies (NASA-GIS)
* Dataset can be downloaded from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sevgisarac/temperature-changes
